    "*   **Required and preferred Skills (Technical & Soft):**  List specific technical skills (e.g., Python, Java, SQL, AWS, project management) and soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, leadership, problem-solving).  Prioritize skills explicitly mentioned as required or essential. For each skill, briefly note the context if specified in the job description (e.g., \"Python for data analysis,\" \"Communication skills for client interaction\"). If levels are specified include those as well (e.g. Intermediate Python).\n",

    "*   **Required Qualifications/Education:**  Specify the necessary educational background (e.g., Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Master's degree in Business Administration) and any required certifications or licenses (e.g., PMP, CPA, AWS Certified Solutions Architect). Be exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Required Experience:**  Detail the required years of experience and the specific areas of experience sought (e.g., \"5+ years of experience in software development,\" \"3+ years of experience in project management within the healthcare industry\"). Note the context of the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Responsibilities (List):**  Briefly list the main responsibilities that are explicitly listed in the job description.\n",

    "    *   Travel requirements (e.g., \"Must be willing to travel up to 25%\")\n",
    "    *   Physical requirements (e.g., \"Ability to lift 50 lbs\")\n",
    "    *   Security clearances (e.g., \"Must be able to obtain a security clearance\")\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",

    "1.  **Read the job description carefully and thoroughly.**\n",
    "2.  **Focus on explicitly stated requirements.**  Infer requirements only when strongly implied and directly supported by the text.\n",

    "4.  **Prioritize \"must-have\" requirements.**  Distinguish between essential requirements and desired or \"nice-to-have\" qualifications if the job description makes that distinction. If there is a distinction, then add a \"Desired Skills/Experience\" Section.\n",
    "5.  **Maintain accuracy.**  Do not add information that is not present in the job description.\n",
